# seq/par quick sort

Comparison of sequenntal and parallel quick sort using OpenCilk for parallelization.

## structure

`src` contains sequental and parallel implementation of quick sort.

`test` contains basic tests for both implementations.

`bench` contains simple benchmarking of two implementations.

## build-and-run

You can build and run with `make`. You may need to modify `CILKINSTALLATION` variable in `Makefile` to make it work correctly.

```sh
# build test and bench binaries
make all 

# build only test binary
make build-test

# build only bench binary
make build-bench

# build and run tests
make run-test

#build and run bench
make run-bench
```
